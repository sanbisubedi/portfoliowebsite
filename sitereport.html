   <h1>My Experience of Learning Web Development</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="divcontent">
        <p>In this term, I have acquired a significant understanding of web developments, coding, design and the ability to correct an erroneous code. From there I learned the fundamentals of the HTML and CSS and slowly developed an understanding of how both technologies came into play for a website. Out of all the tasks, this was the most daunting especially in how to make it adapt to the screen of the gadgets in use. Debugging was another important skill which was quite useful owing to the fact that I was likely to come across a lot of programs that were coded by other people and were likely to contain errors. As is universally the rule in such cases, there were successes and failures along the path. First of all, CSS skills were quite challenging for me, yet I managed to achieve better results, understand how to style the elements and make a better-looking layout. That was during a time when I was trying to create a responsive navigation bar and had tried so many wrong ways. In summary, this web development has been an enlightening module, helping to provide a stable building block for my studies.</p>

        <p>All in all, this module has been proven to be fruitful as well as an endeavoring one. First, the number of the materials concerning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was rather great and at the first glance I had no idea which source I should choose. At first, I never used these languages, but as the term went by, I was comfortable using them. I believe the practical ones beneficial as they offered a practical approach into what had been taught in class. Feedbacks obtained from peer and instructors were also useful and enabled me to enhance my work all through.</p>

            Looking at the general layout of the website, I wanted it to be simple and sleek. For color combination I selected red and white as the dominant colors and the rest of the colors used for various sections of the site. The choices of fonts were also intended for making the text more readable and for achieving the aesthetically pleasant appearance; thus, I employed "Roboto", sans-serif google font due to its clear and uncluttered look. To enhance the usability of my site I made it responsive using CSS media queries to facilitate easy viewing when opened from a computer or a mobile phone and used fontawesome for adding hamburger icon
